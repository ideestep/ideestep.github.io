## Welcome to the Basu Neuro Lab

Our lab is broadly interested in the neural mechanisms underlying navigation and decision-making.

Specifically, we aim to:

1. Understand how the brain forms useful maps of the surrounding environment.  
2. Understand how such maps are used to make flexible navigational decisions.
