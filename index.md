**Welcome to the Basu Neuro Lab.**

Our lab is broadly interested in the neural mechanisms underlying navigation and decision-making. We investigate how the brain constructs internal representations of the surrounding environment, and how these representations are used to support flexible, goal-directed navigational behavior.

Our work combines behavioral experiments, neural recordings, and computational approaches to understand how spatial information is encoded and utilized by the brain.
