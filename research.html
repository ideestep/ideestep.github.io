      Our lab aims to understand how the brain maps the surrounding world,
      which can facilitate informed decision-making. To address these questions,
      we take a highly interdisciplinary approach that involves behavioral training,
      in vivo electrophysiology, neural perturbation techniques, and neural data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broadly, we are pursuing three interconnected research directions.

      <h3>Investigating task-relevant cognitive map formation</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine you have undertaken the impossible task of choosing the perfect
        restaurant for date night. To achieve this, you need a map of highly rated
        restaurants — not just a spatial map, but also information about quality,
        service, cost, etc.

    <div class="column">
      <h3>Studying spatial decisions</h3>
      <p>
        How does the brain juggle between costs and benefits? These decisions are
        unique because all the relevant information is usually beyond one’s sensory
        perception and must be based on internal maps.
      </p>

    <div class="column">
      <h3>Interplay between spatial maps</h3>
      <p>
        One hallmark of intelligence is our ability to flexibly navigate through
        an ever-changing world. We aim to answer how different maps across the
        brain coordinate to enable navigation in complex environments.
