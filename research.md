Our lab aims to understand how the brain maps the surrounding world to support informed decision-making. We use behavioral training, in vivo electrophysiology, neural perturbations, and data analysis.

### Task-relevant cognitive map formation
We study how location, reward, and cost information are integrated to form structured representations of the environment.

### Spatial decision-making
Using Long-Evans rats navigating reward-based environments, we investigate how the brain weighs costs and benefits to select goals.

### Interplay between spatial maps
We examine how spatial representations across brain regions coordinate to support flexible navigation.
